# Objective : Solve 5 Projects on Kaggle (Tabular Data)

## Five Problem Statements

1. **Classification** 
	- Spaceship Titanic: https://www.kaggle.com/c/DontGetKicked
	- Algorithm: (sklearn Logistic Regression)[https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html]
2. **Regression** 
	- House Prices: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques
	sklearn Logistic Regression
3. **Clustering** 
	- Mall Customers: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python
4. **Forecasting** 
	- Store Sales Forecasting: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/store-sales-time-series-forecasting
5. **Text Classification** 
	- Disastor Tweets: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started


## 3 Tips to Launch your Kaggle Problem Solving Journey
1. **Set Goals & Intent**
	1. Guideline - 1 x 2 x 3 Method
		- 1 Problem Statement
		- 2 hours per day 
		- 3 times per week
2. **Start with worst solution & Iterate**
	1. Base solution first 
		- Treat Numerical Missing Values with Median
		- Treat Categorical with Constant Strategy (fill N/A with "Missing")
		- Transform Categorical using One Hot Encoding
		- Build a Logistic Regression
		- Check Accuracy
	2. Iterate - Keep improving one part of solution with each iteration
3. **Solve 5 Problem Statements**
	- Classification - Logistic Regression
	- Regression - Linear Regression
	- Time Series - ARIMA
	- Clustering - K-Means
	- Text Classification - Binary - Positive or Negative 

## Stage wise Execution:
Stage 1: Submit one solution (Logistic Regression)
Stage 2: Feature Engineering (Missing Value, Outlier, Transformation, Validation Strategy, Evaluation Metric)
Stage 3: All Models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision tree, Navie Bayes, SVM, Adaboost)
