# Kaggle Plan

## 3 Tips to Launch your Kaggle Problem Solving Journey
1. **Set Goals & Intent**
	1. Guideline - 1 x 2 x 3 Method
		- 1 Problem Statement
		- 2 hours per day 
		- 3 times per week
2. **Start with worst solution & Iterate**
	1. Base solution first 
		- Treat Numerical Missing Values with Median
		- Treat Categorical with Constant Strategy (fill N/A with "Missing")
		- Transform Categorical using One Hot Encoding
		- Build a Logistic Regression
		- Check Accuracy
	2. Iterate - Keep improving one part of solution with each iteration
3. **Solve 5 Problem Statements**
	- Classification - Logistic Regression
	- Regression - Linear Regression
	- Time Series - ARIMA
	- Clustering - K-Means
	- Text Classification - Binary - Positive or Negative 

## Stage wise Execution:
Stage 1: Submit one solution (Logistic Regression)
Stage 2: Feature Engineering (Missing Value, Outlier, Transformation, Validation Strategy, Evaluation Metric)
Stage 3: All Models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision tree, Navie Bayes, SVM, Adaboost)
